# Heart_Disease_Analysis ‚ù§üìä
# Overview
* The Heart Disease Analysis project aims to explore and analyze factors contributing to heart disease using a comprehensive dataset.
* The insights gained from this analysis can be invaluable for healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals aiming to understand heart disease better.

# Features
* ETL Process:
<br>Extraction: Data sourced from reliable datasets.
<br>Transformation: Data cleaning, normalization, and encoding categorical variables using Python libraries such as Pandas.
<br>Loading: Processed data structured for analysis and visualization.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
<br>Visualizations to explore data distributions, correlations, and trends using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
<br>Identification of key relationships between features and the target variable (presence of heart disease).

* Visualization:
<br>Interactive dashboard displaying key insights and visualizations from the analysis by generating various plots and charts.

# Key Insights
* Sex Distribution: The dataset shows a notable difference in heart disease prevalence between males and females, with a higher percentage of heart disease cases in males.
* Heart Disease Distribution: Approximately more than 150 individuals in the dataset have been diagnosed with heart disease.
* Chest Pain Types: The majority of individuals reporting chest pain experience typical angina, followed by non-anginal, atypical angina and asymtomatic anginal pain.
* Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Normal resting electrocardiographic results with 48.68%, while abnormalities such as ST-T with 50% and LVH with 1.32% are more prevalent in individuals diagnosed with heart disease.
* Slope Distribution: The analysis shows that individuals with heart disease often have a downsloping with 6.95% during peak exercise, compared to those without heart disease who generally show a flat or upsloping with 46.36% and 46.69% respectively.

# Technical Aspects
* The Heart Disease Analysis project is done by extracting valuable insights from heart disease data through a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
* The Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard is developed using Power BI.
